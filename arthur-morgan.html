            Arthur Morgan was effectively adopted by Hosea Matthews and

            a young age, Arthur became Dutch's first protégé.

            Arthur had a son, Isaac, with a waitress named Eliza,

            Arthur never fully coped with their deaths, and the

            Each part of the camp can be upgraded to improve what it has to offer,

                tuberculosis, a bullet to the head, or a knife in the back, depends on

                The first game thats ever made me cry at a character death,
                and I'm not an emotional person but damn this game brought a tear
                to me eye! Arthur was a good man.

                My heart melt when Arthur gave his hat to john.
                Not gonna lie, when Arthur said “thank you” in his dying horse’s ear
                actually made my eyes water. Arthur horse carried him through the whole adventure.

                Ok, so I searched up “Arthur Morgan” on google and it said “Fictional Character”.
                But when he died it felt like somebody that was really close to me died.
                It’s crazy how Rockstar Games can create a character so unique like Arthur Morgan.

                Arthur Morgan is the best damn character Rockstar ever came up with.
                Red Dead Redemption is the only game series that made me cry.

                Not gonna lie I almost cried on the mission that played
                "That's The Way It Is" song. This game is amazing.
                Rockstar doesn’t make games, they produce experiences.

                When Arthur says “I gave you all I had” that line hits right in the feels.
                I cried for a good 5 minutes after this scene. His death was so frustrating and sad.
                Our man Arthur deserved better.

                Damn I remember before this game was released that a lot of people,
                including myself, hated that we'd playing some new guy called Arthur instead of John.
                Turns out Arthur was one of the most impactful characters I've ever had the honor of playing as.

                One of the saddest thing was... watching him die slowly and just to get finished
                of by a rat and get betrayed by Dutch after twenty years over 9 months. RIP Arthur.

                They played just the right song to make me cry. Mr. Morgan -
                I refuse to play Low Honour, because of how attached I am to this man.
