              RDR2 is the Godfather of video games, The Black Album of video games,
              and the magnum opus of Rockstar so far. As evidenced by gameplay,
              tone, sound design, art-style, voice-acting, world-building, and
              so much more, Red Dead Redemption 2 is the most intricately handcrafted
              video game of all time.

              Is RDR2 worth buying?
              RDR2 is much better than the RDR1, it's definitely worth the
              praise. I thought I really loved John Marston as a character but
              Arthur Morgan is just the best character. It is such a good story
              yet its heartbreaking at the same time.

              Red Dead Redemption 2 is at once a startling evolution of the
              Rockstar Games formula and everything a fan could hope for from a Red
              Dead Redemption sequel. ... One of the top three open-worlds of all
              time, and the best game Rockstar has ever made. An all-time Old West masterpiece.

              Not gonna lie I almost cried on the mission that played

              Listening to RDR2 songs makes me cry, I never
              thought that a game could cause me so many emotions, but so many hours,
              the change of Arthur, has surpassed me.
